  database: test_booking_db
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

to etc/postgresql/12/main/pg_hba.conf replace everything under these words:
# DO NOT DISABLE!
If you change this first entry you will need to make sure that the
database superuser can access the database using some other method.
Noninteractive access to all databases is required during automatic
maintenance (custom daily cronjobs, replication, and similar tasks).
Database administrative login by Unix domain socket

to:

local  all       postgres                trust
TYPE DATABASE    USER      ADDRESS         METHOD
"local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local  all       all                   trust
IPv4 local connections:
host  all       all       127.0.0.1/32      trust
IPv6 local connections:
host  all       all       ::1/128         trust
Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
replication privilege.
local  replication   all                   peer
host  replication   all       127.0.0.1/32      md5
host  replication   all       ::1/128         md5


and restart your database

sudo service postgresql restart
